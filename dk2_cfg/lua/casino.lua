--
-- How to use this module
--   require("casino")     at the TOP LEVEL of the level script or init.lua
--   CasinoInit()          inside the level script's OnGameStart() or campaign Init's OnCampaignGameStart()
--
-- Companion files (map-local, named after the map that uses them)
--   <map>.terrain.cfg    CASINO / CASINO_WALL slabs (100/101) + CASINO room (17)
--   <map>.slabset.toml   room graphics, copied from the TREASURY slabs
--   <map>.objects.cfg    CASINO_LEVER_HAPPY / CASINO_LEVER_PROFIT (185/186),
--                        the room's own special-box models
--   <map>.crstates.cfg   custom states in engine slots 55 / 56:
--                          CasinoWalking   (en route to a seat)
--                          CasinoGambling  (seated, playing rounds)
--
-- What happens
--   After CASINO_START_DELAY the casinos are active
--   Creatures inside a casino take a seat and gamble every few seconds. They
--   win or lose their own carried gold; the keeper is the house and gains what
--   they lose. Each room runs in one of two modes, switched by a lever in the
--   middle of the room - one of two special-box models, always the one for the
--   mode you can flip TO, so only ever one of the two is visible:
--     HAPPY  - creatures usually win  -> keeper pays, creatures cheer up
--     PROFIT - creatures usually lose -> keeper earns, creatures get annoyed
--   Rarely a round hits the jackpot: gold piles drop and everyone celebrates.
--
--   Winnings stop at the creature's GoldHold. The engine would not enforce that
--   by itself - gold_carried is an int32 that nothing trims, and GoldHold only
--   gates picking piles off the floor - so the cap is applied here. A creature
--   that is full keeps playing and still enjoys its wins, it just stops being
--   paid out - losing is then what frees room to be paid again.
--
--   CASINO_NO_CREATURE_LOSS turns the house generous: the keeper still collects
--   on every loss, but the gold is conjured instead of taken, so the creature
--   keeps its purse and only takes the mood hit. Nothing is staked there, so that
--   mode also skips the buy-in and never sends a penniless creature home.
--
-- Creature attitudes (CASINO_ATTITUDE below)
--   LIKE     walks in on its own, ranked by CASINO_PRIORITY against its jobs
--   NEUTRAL  only plays when dropped in
--   HATE     gets annoyed when dropped in and leaves at once
--   Nobody gambles before owning a lair, however they got there - see
--   CASINO_REQUIRE_LAIR. A creature whose anger has hit the engine ceiling walks
--   out and is not recruited again until something else calms it down.
--
-- Why some things look roundabout
--   * There is no OnDrop event in the engine, so a creature is flagged while it
--     is in the hand and the landing is resolved on the next tick. Reacting to
--     mere presence in the room instead would also grab passers-by.
--   * Room capacity is counted here, not by the engine: room.used_capacity is
--     read-only from Lua and add_creature_to_work_room() is only ever called
--     from hardcoded C states, so a creature in a custom state is never counted.
--   * Cheer/moan poses are not reachable from Lua yet - see CasinoEmote().

-- is a different struct member). Writing thing.anim_sprite does not help either,
-- because update_creature_graphic_anim() recomputes the animation every tick.

-- HAPPY and SAD therefore draw nothing at all for now: every gambling round
-- already shows a coloured win/loss marker, and a second particle on top would
-- just read as noise. Only DANCE, which has no marker of its own, substitutes an
